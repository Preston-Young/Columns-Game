# Columns-Game

## This is a Pygame rendition of the 1980 video game "Columns". 
The gameplay for it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFJvY1k-rpM

The first module I included was the game logic behind this game.

The second module I included is the Pygame UI of the game.

## Instructions:
My version of the game follows the exact gameplay shown in the video. The player can
move their jewels from left to right and rotate them while they're falling. Once the
jewels land on the bottom of the screen or on another jewel, the jewels will now be
frozen in place. If there's a match of the same 3 colors of any jewel in any direction,
those jewels will disappear and the remaining jewels on the board fall accordingly. If
the jewels land and at least one of the three jewels exceeds the top portion of the screen,
it's game over and my program stops running.

### Controls:
  * Use the left and right arrow keys to move the jewels left and right 
  * Press the spacebar as the jewels are falling to rotate them
  * Press the down arrow key to make the jewels fall faster
  * Press 'q' at any time to quit and close the program
